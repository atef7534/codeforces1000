# Codeforces1000

A collection of solutions to Codeforces problems (≈ rating 800-1100+), solved in **C++**, **Python**, and occasionally **C**.

---

## 📖 Purpose

This repository is a record of my problem-solving journey on Codeforces.
It contains solved problems of increasing difficulty, beginning with easier tasks, to build skill in algorithms, data structures, and implementation.

The repo serves as both a personal archive and a resource for others preparing for competitive programming.

## 🛠 Languages & Topics

-   **Languages**:

    -   C++ (main language)
    -   Python (some solutions)
    -   C (few solutions)

-   **Topics covered**:
    -   Greedy Algorithms
    -   Strings & String Manipulation
    -   Mathematics & Number Theory
    -   Constructive Algorithms
    -   Basic Implementation
    -   (and more as problems progress)

---

## 🗂 Structure

-   Each file or folder corresponds to one Codeforces problem (named/numbered).
-   Solutions are organized by problem rather than by topic or difficulty.
-   All solutions are written to be compiled and tested locally.

Example structure:
034-Arpa’s_hard_exam_and_Mehrdad’s_naive_cheat/
solution.cpp
050-New_Year_and_Hurry/
main.py
...

## 🚀 How to use

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/atef7534/codeforces1000.git
    cd codeforces1000
    ```

2. Navigate to a problem folder:
   cd #034-Arpa’s_hard_exam_and_Mehrdad’s_naive_cheat

3. Compile & run (C++ example):
   g++ solution.cpp -std=c++17 -O2 -o solution
   ./solution < input.txt

Or run with Python:
python3 main.py < input.txt

🚧 Future Improvements

-   Add problem ratings and tags for each solution.

-   Group problems by topic (Greedy, Math, Strings, etc.).

-   Add explanations / editorials for harder problems.

-   Create a test framework for automated checking.
